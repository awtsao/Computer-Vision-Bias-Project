This repo contains code for the final project for CS 6670 (advanced computer vision) written by myself and [Dhruv Sreevinas](https://github.com/dhruvsreenivas) in fall semester of 2021. This repo has been transfered from my Cornell enterprise github account to my personal github account for public viewing. In our final project, we study bias in state of the art semi and semi-supervised models. Specifically, we focused on FixMatch for the semi-supervised algorithm and SimCLR for self-supervised. More details can be found in our [writeup](6670_Final_Report.pdf)
